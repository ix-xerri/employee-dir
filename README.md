employee-dir
============

An employee directory courtesy of http://coenraets.org/blog/phonegap-tutorial/ with a simple node.js server that is able to server static files.

Just run 'node server.js' and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. If you want to try it in phonegap, server.js is not needed. Just places the files in the www directory and build.

Tested and works in iOS
